From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

This is a learning project to recreate the Google hompage. It was a test of introductory HTML and CSS skills.
I found it challenging to get everything placed correctly using CSS. However I learned a lot in the process.
